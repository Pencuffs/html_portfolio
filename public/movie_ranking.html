    <h2>The top 3 movies of all time for me</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>
Just watch and admire the best villain ever who is just too attractive so that you unconsciously stand on his side. Fxxk Batman!<br />
One of the first movies where the villain is way more attractive than the hero and does not defeat like all the stereotypical villains do.
</p>

<h3>Ratatoulle</h3>
<p>
I know that you will think: "An animation?"<br />
But you won't be disappointed - like the motto in the movie, anything can be the best movie!
</p>

<h3>Eternal Sunshine of Spotless Mind</h3>
<p>
Jim Carrey does not only play funny characters!<br />
The memory breakdown scene in the climax was one of the most touching moments.
